                  The UX Content Team was new in the project's second phase. We worked closely with Designers, Researchers, and Developers on a 42-person agile team.
                  Phase 1 focused on researching and designing for the mentee side of the platform. Phase 2 continued with the mentee side and began working on the mentor side of the platform. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our team audited existing designs from Phase 1, developed the initial Voice and Tone and Content Style Guide, wrote copy for both sides of the platform, and worked with Design on content strategy.

              Clarify copy  
              Based on Phase 1 usability testing, potential mentees desired increased clarity in regard to the purpose of the mentorship platform and its safety features. Research indicated a desire for guidance, personalization, and inclusivity. Potential mentees also felt the site was lacking personality.

              Based on preliminary findings from Phase 2, potential mentors struggle with imposter syndrome and seek support and resources from Sean's Legacy, as well as a community of other mentors to lean on. Potential mentors also have concerns around safety and privacy.

            <Text className="mb-4 mt-4">
              Both mentees and mentors are interested in connecting over shared interests, hobbies, and backgrounds. 
              <br />
              <br />
              As the content team was new in this phase, copy was rather vague and content was not yet standardized. The product voice was not determined, making it difficult to bring personality or a sense of trust to the platform.
