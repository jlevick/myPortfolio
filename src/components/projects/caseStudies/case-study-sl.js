                  The UX Content Team was new in the project's second phase. We worked closely with Designers, Researchers, and Developers on a 42-person agile team.
                  Phase 1 focused on researching and designing for the mentee side of the platform. Phase 2 continued with the mentee side and began working on the mentor side of the platform.

                  <br />
                  How I helped:
                  <li>Audited exisiting designs</li>
                  <li>Developed the initial Voice and Tone and Content Style Guide</li>
                  <li>Worked with Research to understand user needs</li>
                  <li>Wrote copy for both sides of the platform</li>
                  <li>Collaborated with Design on content strategy</li>
                  <li>Consulted with Development on feature feasibility</li>

              Based on Phase 1 usability testing, potential mentees desire increased clarity in regard to the purpose of the mentorship platform and its safety features. Research indicated a desire for guidance, personalization, and inclusivity.

            <Title variant="cardSm">Mentors</Title>
              <Text className="mb-4 mt-4">
              Based on preliminary findings from Phase 2, potential mentors struggle with imposter syndrome and seek support, resources, and a community of other mentors to lean on. Potential mentors also have concerns around safety and privacy.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mb-4 mt-4">
              Both mentees and mentors are interested in connecting over shared interests, hobbies, and backgrounds.

            As the content team was new in this phase, copy and content were not yet standardized. The product voice was not determined, making it difficult to bring personality and a sense of trust to the platform. 
            <br /> Our solution was to <b>clarify safety and privacy features while offering supportive, user-appropriate language</b>.
